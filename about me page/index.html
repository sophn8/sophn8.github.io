		<div id="description">My name is Sophia Ng. I also respond to "Soph," so feel free to call me that too. I was born and raised in New York City. In August of 2011, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area for college. In December of 2014, I earned two Bachelor of Arts degrees in Political Science and Interdisciplinary American Studies from the University of California, Berkeley. My academic interests lie in the principles of global citizenship, human rights, and social justice.<br><br>As an undergraduate, I served as the Managing Editor for <b><a href="hardboiled.berkeley.edu">hardboiled</a></b>, an Asian Pacific American (APA) newsmagazine that seeks to serve as a vehicle for activism by critically discussing intersectional identities in the APA community. During my sophomore year, I served as a former director of ASUC Vote Coalition, a community organization that registered over 8,500 voters for the 2012 national elections. I also worked as a Research Assistant at the Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science where I researched racial cues in news media during the 2008 and 2012 election cycles. Off-campus, I have interned at a political consulting firm in New York City, a national civil rights non-profit in Washington, D.C., and a microfinance organization in San Francisco.<br><br>My capstone undergraduate experience was my semester abroad at the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Politics and Public Administration and Journalism and Media Centre. During my four months abroad, I traveled to Central and Southwestern Thailand, Malaysian Borneo, Cambodia, and Macau. In my free time, I enjoy reading zines, listening to Simon & Garfunkel, and maintaining a personal blog. I aspire to travel and work abroad in my 20's in the fields of international human rights law and/or international development.
