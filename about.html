		<div id="heading">About</div>

		<div id="subheading">Born and raised in Queens, I'm a proud product of the New York City public school system. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Political Science and <a href="http://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/graduates/detail/3557">Interdisciplinary American Studies</a>, and earned a certificate in <a href="http://community.dsilglobal.com/#class-of-2015">Designing for Social Innovation and Leadership</a> from the UN Centre for Peace. 

		<br><br>I'm a highly organized and thoughtful professional, and aspire to merge my interests in technology, social innovation, and civic action in my career. I have experience working in tech, non-profit, and political consulting sectors. A former Board Member of the <a href="https://napawf.org/chapters/find-a-chapter/new-york-city/">New York City chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum</a> and Participatory Review Committee Member at the <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2017/1/19/a-collaboration-worth-talking-about-16-funders-working-together-for-women-girls-of-color-in-nyc">New York Women’s Foundation’s Fund for Girls and Young Women of Color</a>, I'm also passionate about the intersections of gender and race. Most recently, I served as a Fulbright grantee in Malaysia where I taught English classes, managed peer mentorship and social entrepreneurship programs, facilitated skills-based technology workshops, and implemented public diplomacy initiatives. 
		
		<br><br>In my free time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and bicycling. I'm an adventurous hole-in-the-wall restaurant foodie. Someday, I hope to own a boba dance club.
