		<div id="subheading">A native New Yorker, I recently graduated from Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs where I studied Data Analytics, Management, and Urban Policy. I earned my BA in Political Science and <a href="http://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/graduates/detail/3557">Interdisciplinary American Studies</a> from UC Berkeley, and a certificate in <a href="http://community.dsilglobal.com/#class-of-2015">Designing for Social Innovation and Leadership</a> from the UN Centre for Peace. 

		<br><br>I have professional experience in data analysis, program management, and product research, along with building internal tools to monitor platform abuse. A former Board Member of the <a href="https://napawf.org/chapters/find-a-chapter/new-york-city/">New York City chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum</a> and Participatory Review Committee Member at the <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2017/1/19/a-collaboration-worth-talking-about-16-funders-working-together-for-women-girls-of-color-in-nyc">New York Women’s Foundation’s Fund for Girls and Young Women of Color</a>, I'm also passionate about equity, opportunity, and inclusion. My most thrilling life experience to date was when I served as a Fulbright grantee in Malaysia: I taught English classes, managed peer mentorship and social entrepreneurship programs, facilitated skills-based technology workshops, and implemented public diplomacy initiatives in the town of Gopeng. 
		
		<br><br>I'm adroit at making things happen, and pride myself with my strong work ethic and organizational skills. My peers in Malaysia nominated me for these superlatives, and I think they most uniquely capture my personality and attitude:

		<ul>
  			<li>Most likely to create order out of chaos</li>
  			<li>Most likely to manage a Form 4 Malaysian boy band</li>
 			<li>Most likely to be the next Bill Gates</li>
  			<li>Most likely to rise like a phoenix from a shitty thing</li>
  			<li>Best at naming things</li>
		</ul>
