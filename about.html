		<div id="heading">About</div>
		<div id="subheading">I'm currently a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Perak, Malaysia. As an English Teaching Assistant, I co-teach ten English classes, manage design thinking and peer mentoring programs, organize English Camps, and hang out with Malaysian teens all day.
			<br><br>
			Prior to Malaysia, I was a Senior Analyst on the Integrity team at <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> in Brooklyn, NY. In my role, I focused on payments risk and fraud on the site. I also volunteered as a Board Member of the <a href="https://napawf.org/chapters/find-a-chapter/new-york-city/">New York City chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum</a> and as a Member of the inaugural New York Women's Foundation Participatory Review Committee, a committee that supports the New York City Fund for Girls and Young Women of Color Fund (The Fund).
			<br><br>
			I earned my Bachelor's degree in Political Science and <a href="http://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/graduates/detail/3557">Interdisciplinary American Studies</a> from UC Berkeley. As an undergraduate, I spent a semester abroad studying journalism, globalization, and politics at the University of Hong Kong. Following graduation, I received a certificate in <a href="http://community.dsilglobal.com/#class-of-2015">Designing for Social Innovation and Leadership</a> from the UPEACE Centre for Executive Education. 
			<br><br>
			I have experience managing an Asian Pacific American newsmagazine, facilitating a student-led course on ethnic press, and mobilizing thousands of students to vote. I'm passionate about community organizing, civic engagement, and intersectional feminism. Professionally, I'm interested in leveraging the intersections between technology and social innovation.  
			<br><br>
			In my free time, I enjoy yoga, hiking, and bicycling. I'm an adventurous hole-in-the-wall restaurant foodie. Someday, I hope to own a boba dance club.
