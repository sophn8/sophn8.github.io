		<div id="description">My name is Sophia <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNYOEgMeSvM" target="_blank">Ng</a>. I respond to "Soph," so feel free to call me that too. I was born and raised in New York City. In August of 2011, I moved across the country to the San Francisco Bay Area for college. I also took a semester abroad at the University of Hong Kong where I studied journalism, globalization, and politics. In December of 2014, I earned two Bachelor of Arts degrees in Political Science and Interdisciplinary American Studies from the UC Berkeley. I'm interested in the intersections among human rights, social justice, and social entrepreneurship.<br><br>As an undergraduate, I served as the Managing Editor for <b><a href="http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">hardboiled</a></b>, an Asian Pacific American (APA) newsmagazine that seeks to serve as a vehicle for activism by critically discussing intersectional identities in the APA community. During my sophomore year, I served as a Director of the ASUC Vote Coalition, a community organization that registered over 8,500 voters for the 2012 national elections. (True story: Once, I unwittingly tried to register Steve Wozniak to vote at the Greek Theater.) I also worked as a Research Assistant at the Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science where I researched racial cues in news media during the 2008 and 2012 election cycles. Off-campus, I've interned at a political consulting firm in New York City, a national civil rights non-profit in Washington, D.C., and a microfinance organization in San Francisco.<br><br>I aspire to travel and work abroad in my 20s in the fields of international human rights law and/or international development. Right now, I live and work in the city that never sleeps-- I seriously took NYC's 24/7 public transportation for granted while I was away! In my free time, I enjoy reading zines, listening to Simon & Garfunkel, and trying to rock climb. I often take photos of my food and don't care what you think.<br><br><i>Shout out to the Web Design Decal for teaching me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!</i>
