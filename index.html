		<div id="subheading">I'm currently a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter Integrity Analyst</a>, a <a href="https://napawf.org/chapters/find-a-chapter/new-york-city/">NAPAWF*NYC Board Member</a>, and a <a href="http://community.dsilglobal.com/#class-of-2015">Designing for Social Innovation and Leadership Participant</a>.<br><br>In December of 2014, I graduated with degrees in Political Science and <a href="http://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/graduates/detail/3557">Interdisciplinary American Studies</a> from UC Berkeley. I also spent a semester abroad studying journalism, globalization, and politics at the University of Hong Kong. At uni, I was the Managing Editor of <a href="hardboiled.berkeley.edu"><b>hardboiled</b>: Asian Pacific American newsmagazine</a>, Director of Student Groups in the <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2012/10/25/asuc-vote-coalition-registers-8000-students-to-vote/">ASUC Vote Coalition</a>, and a Research Apprentice at the Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science. I spent my three summers in college interning at <a href="http://www.kiva.org">Kiva</a> in San Francisco, <a href="http://www.ocanational.org/?">OCA - Asian Pacific American Advocates</a> in Washington, DC, and Hudson TG in New York City.<br><br>I was born and raised in Queens, New York. During my junior year at Cal, I was a Bobarista at Boba Guys. I'm an avid fan of French Bulldogs (they look like frogs), Totoro, and Bob's Burgers. In the mornings, you can catch me YouTubing GoPro travel videos, Asian cooking shows, and Drunk History. Outdoor activities are fun. I enjoy hiking in the late summer/early fall, bicycling on Joe Michael's Mile, and trying new hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Someday I hope to own a boba dance club.</div><br><br><br>
