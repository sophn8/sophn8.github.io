		<div id="subheading">I'm currently an Integrity Analyst at <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> and a <a href="https://napawf.org/chapters/find-a-chapter/new-york-city/">NAPAWF*NYC Board Member.</a>
			<br><br>
			I earned my Bachelor's degree in Political Science and <a href="http://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/graduates/detail/3557">Interdisciplinary American Studies</a> from UC Berkeley. As an undergraduate, I spent a semester abroad studying journalism, globalization, and politics at the University of Hong Kong. Following graduation, I received a certificate in <a href="http://community.dsilglobal.com/#class-of-2015">Designing for Social Innovation and Leadership</a> from the UPEACE Centre for Executive Education. 
			<br><br>
			I have experience managing an Asian Pacific American newsmagazine, facilitating a student-led course on ethnic press, and mobilizing thousands of students to vote. I'm passionate about activism, community organizing, and youth empowerment. Professionally, I'm interested in leveraging the intersections between technology and social innovation.  
			<br><br>
			In my free time, I enjoy yoga, hiking, and bicycling. I'm an adventurous hole-in-the-wall restaurant foodie. Someday, I hope to own a boba dance club.
