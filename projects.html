		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>My team, <a href="https://sophn8.github.io/GreenItUp/">GreenItUp</a>, designed and pitched a browser extension that looks at products in a user's online shopping cart and offers comparable substitutions that are more sustainable yet still within their price range, as part of <a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/ideas-lab/deans-public-policy-challenge-grant/current-competition">Columbia SIPA's Dean's Public Policy Challenge</a>. I was tasked with all things technical: I built the website via Bootstrap, designed mockups via InVision, and drafted product specs. We won second place!
			<li>I used Python (and Matplotlib and Pandas) to uncover the <a href="https://github.com/sophn8/computing_in_context/blob/master/shsat_schools_race.ipynb">Demographics of the Top 10 Specialized High School Feeder Middle Schools in New York City</a>.
			<li>I used R to explore <a href="https://github.com/sophn8/data_mining/blob/master/README.md"> Mitski's Discography Through Text Mining</a>.
			<li> I <a href="https://medium.com/@swn2111/mobile-money-a-success-story-4396f1c980ed">wrote</a> about mobile money for one of my favorite classes in grad school, "Policies and Practices in Digital Development".  
			<li>In 2017, I was lucky enough to travel to ten different countries. Check out my GoPro video compilation on <a href="https://vimeo.com/249679898">Vimeo</a>!
			<li>I delivered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU3GZC7j9Gg&t=145s">speech</a> about my experiences navigating cultural diversity both in Malaysia and in the United States at the Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship (ETA) Showcase in Putrajaya.
			<li>As a Fulbright ETA grantee, I coached an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/SCatalystSIS/posts/?ref=page_internal">incredible team of students</a> in an 8-week social entrepreneurship competition, directed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4MC0wJD2JM">music video</a> of a popular Bahasa Melayu song that my class translated into English, and had the unanticipated honor of being a dance mom for a weekend at the National Creative Action Camp in Kuala Lumpur. 
	  		<li>I led the creation of <a href="http://celebratingoursisters.tumblr.com/">Celebrating Our Sisters: Asian Pacific American Women of New York City</a>: A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NAPAWFNYC/">NAPAWF*NYC</a> storytelling project to celebrate APA sisters of New York City.</li>
	  		<li><a href="http://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/graduates/?y=2014">Channels for Change: Sesame Street’s Ability to Implement Civil Rights Ideology in Children’s Programming</a>: I wrote a 50-something page senior thesis exploring the origins of Sesame Street.</li>
	  		<li>The <a href="https://www.sophn8.com">site</a> that you're on right now. I made it using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript.</li>
