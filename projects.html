			<li>My team, <a href="https://sophn8.github.io/GreenItUp/">GreenItUp</a>, designed and pitched a browser extension that looks at products in a user's online shopping cart and offers comparable substitutions that are more sustainable yet still within their price range, as part of <a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/ideas-lab/deans-public-policy-challenge-grant/current-competition">Columbia SIPA's Dean's Public Policy Challenge</a>. I was tasked with all things technical: I built the website via Bootstrap, designed mockups via InVision, and drafted product specs. We won second place!

			<li>I used R to explore <a href="https://github.com/sophn8/data_mining/blob/master/README.md"> Mitski's Discography Through Text Mining</a>.
			<li>I used R to provide a data-driven analyses to the question: <a href="https://github.com/sophn8/music_analyses/tree/master/TSwift">is T. Swift getting angstier?</a>.

			<li>The <a href="https://www.sophn8.com">site</a> that you're on right now. I made it using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript.</li>

			<li>With a team of six graduate students, I conducted expert interviews, synthesized recommendations, and led the editing process of the report to understand the potential of <a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/academics/capstone-projects/cash-transfer-programming-adolescents-emergencies">cash transfer programming for adolescents in emergencies</a>.
			<li>I tend to create video montages when I travel on <a href="https://vimeo.com/sophn8">Vimeo</a>.
